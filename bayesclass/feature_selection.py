Abstract: Weighted entropy is the measure of information supplied by a 
probablistic experiment whose elementary events are characterized both by their
objective probabilities and by some qualitative (objective or subjective) 
weights. The properties, the axiomatics and the maximum value of the weighted 
entropy are given.
